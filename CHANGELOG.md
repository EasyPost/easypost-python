### Breaking Changes

- Bumps minimum Python version from 2.7 to 3.6
- Bumps all dependencies
- Removes `shipment.get_rates()` method since the shipment object already has rates. If you need to get new rates for a shipment, please use the `shipment.regenerate_rates()` method.

- Removes the unusable `carrier` param from `Address.create_and_verify()` along with the dead `message` conditional check
- Must pass a list object to `shipment.lowest_rate()` rather than a comma-separated list

### Features
